The school ushered in the Chinese New Year with great celebrations and festivities on 20 January 2023. The students were treated to an energetic lion dance from a local dance troupe and auspicious ang-pows from our very own Mr Cheliyan as the God of Prosperity. They also enjoyed captivating performance from their fellow students, including the dancers from the Sports and Recreation Club., and were able to flex their general knowledge of Chinese New Year celebrations by participating in a quiz game show. Several members of the Outram Chinese Alumni made an appearance by singing and performing Mandarin songs, while some of our teachers performed in a dance item. 

This was certainly a crackling start to the new year!
