On 4 Feb 2023, the day before 元宵节, the Outram Chinese Alumni held a Chinese New Year and Birthday Party Celebration for more than 80 alumni who turned up in auspicious bright colours to celebrate their friendship that dates back to the 1960s and 70s. Food-a-galore was of course a main feature, not forgetting another blessing from the 财神爷 to augur a prosperous 2023.
 
No party is complete, of course, without their favourite Karaoke session, a Lantern Riddle Game, a final round of 捞鱼生, and the crowning birthday cake. We certainly cannot go home with any less when lifelong friends as such come together, especially during the Spring Festival! 祝大家喜气洋洋， 青春永驻， 友谊万岁!!!
