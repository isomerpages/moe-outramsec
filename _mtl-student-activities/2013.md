#### **TCM Health Carnival at Toa Payoh Central on 27 October 2013**

Our school participated in the TCM Health Carnival on 27 October 2013 at Toa Payoh Central, an event jointly organised by Toa Payoh Central Community Club and Singapore Chinese Physicians’ Association.

We put up display on our TCM programme, students’ project work, Chinese herbs and their uses. This event was a good learning experience for our Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 HCL students as they shared their knowledge on Traditional Chinese Medicine and interacted with the public and Dr Ng Eng Hen.

#### **Three Generation TCM Healthy Awareness Carnival 2013**

On 17 March 2013, Sunday, our school was used as the venue for "Three Generation TCM Healthy Awareness Carnival". This event was organised by People’s Association Active Ageing Council and Chinese Physicians’ Association, with Dr Lily Neo as the Guest-of-Honour. Outram Secondary School, Qigong Shi Ba Shi Association and Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Community Club Senior Citizens Executive Committee were the supporting partners for this event.

The programme for the day included Mass Qigong exercise, TCM seminars, TCM exhibition, TCM consultation, TCM Acupuncture, Cupping and Scrapping. Our HCL students participated as presenters at our school’s exhibition booth, introducing the TCM curriculum and their project work to the members of the public. Herbal tea was also served at the booth. About 100 Outramians also participated in this event as student helpers, serving food, ushering the public around the school compound and helping out at the TCM consultation area. With the support of the school staff, the event was held successfully, and our students benefitted greatly from this experience.

Song items were also presented by our talented Outram teachers. Mr Ng Yan Kong sang a Chinese song “春天里” while five techers Mr Mao Cham Nap, Ms Tan Xi Ling, Ms Nurrul, Ms Goh Ban Leng and Ms Yap Qiu Hong sang the Chinese song “朋友”.

Three of our Sec 2 HCL students showcased their Chinese martial arts skills with the performance entitled “横扫千军密如雨”. A group of Sec 3 and Sec 4 HCL students also put up an entertaining skit “白蛇话团圆”.

Our school Band presented two beautiful pieces of music “细水长流” and “Party Rock Anthem”, while our Chinese Orchestra brought to us two melodious music pieces “大地回春” and “金蛇狂舞”.

Towards the end of the celebration, we welcomed the God of Fortune accompanied by Mingfu from Sec 4/4, Anifah and Fatimah from Sec 3/1, Aman, Choon Hwee and Wen Qing from Sec 1/2B with an entertaining gangnam-style dance.
