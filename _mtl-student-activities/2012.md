#### **Toa Payoh TCM Health Carnival 2012**

On 28 October 2012, the Mother Tongue Language Department CL Unit participated in the Toa Payoh TCM Health Carnival organized by Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution. The Guest-of-Honour for this event was Dr Ng Eng Hen.

Our team of teachers and the Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 Higher Chinese Language (HCL) students set up a booth to introduce to the public the 2-year Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) programme offered by the school under the Enhanced HCL Curriculum. Students had a good time of interaction with the public as they shared with them their knowledge on Traditional Chinese Medicine and their project work.



#### **Traditional chinese medicine festival 2012**

Our school participated in the 1st Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Festival held at Hong Lim Park on 17 March 2012. This event was organised by Chung Hwa Medical Institution in celebration of their 60th Anniversary. We were one of the two schools highlighted to offer TCM lessons for students. TCM is part of our Enhanced Higher Chinese Language (HCL) Curriculum.

We put up exhibitions on our school’s 2-year TCM programme, exhibited students’ project work and provided some useful TCM information related to our daily life. Our Sec 2 and Sec 3 HCL students were also present at the booth to interact with members of the public.

It was an enriching experience for our students. We received many positive feedbacks from the public, affirming our programme and praising our students for their good presentation.

#### **Chinese New Year Celebration 2012**

To usher in the Year of Dragon in January, the Mother Tongue Language Department organized a series of activities. Besides the usual festive decorations which were put up around the school, Penmanship and Chinese Calligraphy Competitions were carried out. A Spring Festival Concert was also held on 20th January 2012. The programme started off with an entertaining video featuring the Outram staff conveying their new year greetings, followed by a Chinese Riddle Contest.

Senior citizen Mdm Goh Kim Eng presented us with a song “春天里”. The audiences were dazzled by our school dancing groups who performed a Modern Ballet Dance entitled “Passion”, a Hip-Hop Dance “Optimistic” and an Ethnic Dance “Blessings” . Some of our Chinese students also showcased their singing talent in the songs “对你有感觉”and “不够成熟”.

Outram students are full of talent and so are the teachers. Two of the young teachers, Ms Serene Cheong &amp; Mrs Gracies Leong, presented a lovely Mandarin song “细水长流”.

A group of HCL students put up an interesting and educational skit entitled “Save Our Environment” while our Secondary Four HCL students showcased their Martial Arts talents with the”刀影拳风迎新年”.The climax of the concert came with the arrival of the God of Fortune and his assistants, the Big-head Dolls. Our school Band and Chinese Orchestra presented the audience with melodious music pieces, including “月亮代表我的心”, “Lady Gaga Dance Mix”, ”龙腾虎跃”, “大地回春”and “恭喜恭喜”.

Towards the end of the concert, the agile footwork and the performance put up by the Lion Dance Troupe added to the festive atmosphere in the school hall. The finale was the group singing of the song “贺新年” by the school staff and invited guests. After the concert, all invited guests and school staff proceeded to the amphitheatre where they were enjoyed yusheng and light refreshments, along with a karaoke session.
