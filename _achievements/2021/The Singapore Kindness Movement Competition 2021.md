#### Outramians Showcase Poetry-writing Prowess


The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) organised an annual national poetry and story-writing competition that serves as a platform for secondary schools, junior colleges, centralised institutes, madrasahs and international schools in Singapore to showcase their creative writing ability.     

  

As part of the English Department’s iStretch programme, Outram Secondary sent in a total of three entries in the poetry-writing category with poems meant for children between the ages of 9 and 12. Of the three entries, ‘Sharing the Limelight’ and ‘Helping a Neighbour’ were awarded the first and second prizes respectively in that category, outperforming competitors from the other schools.      

  

The students who took part in the competition went back to school during the year-end holidays to brainstorm and work on their entries before it was submitted in November. We would like to congratulate the talented participants from Secondary 2/2A:

  

*   Aryisha Binte Muhd Reymie
*   Layla Karina Binte Kamal
*   Danial Haqim Macdonald
*   Ho Darren Mitchell Mahilum
*   Jude Michael Chua
*   Martin Ethan Mina
