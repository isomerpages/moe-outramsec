Outram Secondary School recruited the Chinese stream students and there were a total of 12 batches of students since 1969.

On the 28 September 2019, Mr Lawrence Ng, Chairman of the Chinese Stream Alumni, and committee members organised a  50th Anniversary Dinner at Outram Secondary School.   

  

The event gathered more than 200 participants from 12 different batches,  including their teachers.  It was definitely a joyous and memorable night for many of them as they reminisce their good old days spent  in Outram Secondary School.
