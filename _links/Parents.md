<img src="/images/ecol2.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> 2020 marks the start of our College’s 51st year. This is also a year of an unprecedented disruption of school and schooling which we were accustomed to. All stakeholders of our school community have had to adjust to an online mode of teaching and learning enacted outside of the school building. I am glad our teachers and students have been able to exercise mental and behavioural flexibility to adjust quickly to a changed environment. <br><br>

Despite the change thrusted upon us, we must remain steadfast, to provide our students an education that helps them to seek to know how to think, not just what to think. We must continue to focus on educating the heart and the mind, and endeavour to instil in our students the CARE values and principles that our school has promulgated. We must pride ourselves to help our students grow and develop into adults with a deep sense of service to the community. <br><br>

As we complete 50 years of service and embark on our 51st year, we should take heed that success comes to those who work hard and stays with those who don’t rest on the achievements of the past. We must continue to strive and to serve with honour. <br><br>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders. We are fortunate to have a supportive and committed School Advisory Committee, dedicated teachers, concerned and co- operative parents. <br><br>

Service with Honour. <br>

      <p>We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate our teachers, who have dedicated 25, 15 and 10 years to the education service respectively. <br> <br>

I hope that they will not be afraid of mistakes but rather have the courage to try once more. I want them to be able to not only take away subject knowledge but also values and morals from their journey in NJC.” <br><a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/262bf955209f9ed5c4387c3bf18ec370c7effbaf/e751f/images/aa1.png">Mr Dassiah Victor John</a> <br><br>

They need not necessarily become doctors or scientists, but at the end of the day I hope that they are competent and able to analyse issues and think critically, such that their opinions about certain issues related to Science emerge.” <br> <a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0b913a1c207e350f87cc47d118f261b266b6412d/93646/images/aa5.png">Mr Lim Wee Liang</a><br>

I would also want them to develop empathy and learn to uplift others as they grow up to become good citizens and leaders with sound values. I believe that these traits are important to guide them through the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world in this 21st century.” <br><a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5c6e7a485a6fe8b681f380fed3bac88992e4b98b/bed37/images/aa6.png">Mr Ng Joon Hong</a><br><br>

You have to really stop just thinking about yourselves but about each other. There is a difference between pleasure (playing video games, handphone usage etc) and joy (finding pursuits where you add value to others’ lives). Over time, I hope that you will reduce activities that give you pleasure.“ <a href="https://moe-nationaljc-staging.netlify.app/files/Shanmugadas.pdf">Mr Shanmugadas S/O Kumaresadas</a><br> 
				<img src="/images/ecol13.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “The most satisfying moment for any teacher is when his student, after years, remembers him and quotes a few small incidents that touched the student’s life. What looks small to me would have made all the difference in the student’s life and the feeling is just awesome. No amount of money can give you the satisfaction that I get watching my students grow.” <br><a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/59dd33c962a14ed2e9ee368916a8a8a157e0b814/11577/images/aa7.png">Mr Wee Keng Han</a><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol14.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I am motivated when I see the smiles that appear on the students’ face or the “Eureka” moment in their eyes when they have grasped a difficult concept or topic. Everyone learns differently and one of the high points in the teaching journey is to have the opportunity to be creative, think of various activities to make learning fun and scientific concepts easy to understand such that students can learn effectively. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing that you can make an impact on students’ life with the chance to better each student, both academically and also as a person.” <br> <a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e226dfe9a1775f92588d9ea0916b5ae95fed513e/6b52c/images/aa8.png">Ms Wong Lilan</a> <br> <br>

As a teacher, there is no one fixed common goal that I want all of them to achieve, other than that they grow up to become people with the right character values, who will use what they have learnt to help improve society and those who can benefit from their contributions.” <br> <a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/42ab08dd0a93b09104796254f4a3c631ce0e8e7b/6a23f/images/aa10.png">Mr Lee Jian Hao Jason</a><br>

As much as having dreams is important, they should also commit to putting in the hard work necessary for producing the results that they want to achieve. Above all, they should commit to being good people who care for others and help to build each other up.” <a href="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c08270221ca447ffcdfcc70d3aac64ee3044d686/c694b/images/aa11.png">Mdm Lim Hui Mei, Jan</a> <br>
