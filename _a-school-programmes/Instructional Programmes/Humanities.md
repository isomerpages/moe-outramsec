<p><strong>Value of Humanities:</strong>
</p>
<p>At the heart of the Humanities curriculum is our commitment to preparing
students to be thoughtful and responsible citizens of tomorrow. We aim
to deepen their understanding of the interconnectedness between Singapore
and the wider world, while fostering an appreciation for the complexities
of the human experience.</p>
<p>Through the study of Humanities, students develop the competencies needed
to thrive in a globalised and rapidly changing world. Inquiry-based learning
nurtures critical thinking and the ability to construct well-reasoned responses
to real-world issues that impact their daily lives, supporting the acquisition
of 21st Century Competencies (21CC).</p>
<p>We strive to equip our students with the knowledge and skills to make
meaningful connections between the past and present. By understanding how
historical developments shape today’s world, they cultivate disciplined,
analytical minds capable of navigating an increasingly volatile, uncertain,
complex, and ambiguous environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Approaches:</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;We adopt an inquiry-based learning approach that anchors the study
of Humanities in authentic, real-world contexts. This pedagogical method
encourages students to take an active role in their learning by asking
meaningful questions, formulating hypotheses, gathering and analysing data,
and constructing evidence-based conclusions. Through hands-on and experiential
learning opportunities, students explore complex societal issues and human
behaviours, fostering deeper engagement and understanding.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students learn to critically evaluate the credibility
and relevance of information sources. They develop digital discernment
and an ethical awareness of technology’s impact, learning to use such tools
responsibly and purposefully. This cultivates thoughtful, tech-savvy learners
who are prepared to navigate the complexities of a digital and interconnected
world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Signature Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<p>To deepen engagement and provide authentic learning experiences, our Humanities
curriculum is enriched by a range of Signature Programmes designed to bring
inquiry to life. Students participate in Geography, History, and Social
Studies Investigations, where they conduct fieldwork, analyse sources,
and explore contemporary issues through guided inquiry. These experiences
help them apply academic concepts to real-world contexts and sharpen their
critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Selected students also take on the role of <em>Humanities Ambassadors,</em> to
raise awareness on civic topics like the significance of elections, fostering
a sense of social responsibility and active citizenship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Additionally, students have opportunities to showcase their knowledge
and communication skills through national-level competitions such as <em>What’s The News?</em> and
the <em>Singapore Model United Nations</em>, where they engage in current
affairs, policy discussions, and global issues, further honing their analytical
and oratorical abilities. These signature programmes collectively cultivate
confident, informed, and globally aware learners.</p>
