<h3><strong>üí° Skills Development</strong></h3>
<p><strong>‚ÄúLearning is a consequence of thinking.‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Ron Ritchhart</p>
<p>In our EL and Literature classrooms, we embrace this belief by creating
thinking classrooms where students are empowered to reflect on their own
learning, apply strategies independently, and make meaning of texts in
critical, creative and collaborative ways. Our programmes nurture empathetic
readers, persuasive writers, and reflective thinkers, equipping students
with the communication and critical thinking skills needed to engage with
the world meaningfully.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Students
interpret and evaluate diverse texts‚Äîfrom advertisements to literary works.</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Communication:</strong> They
express personal voice across modes‚Äîthrough podcasts, debates, drama, and
writing‚Äîguided by a Communication Progression Map.</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Group
projects like tableaux, advertisements, and performance tasks teach students
to co-construct meaning and respect multiple perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Approaches</strong>
</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Inquiry Through Dialogue:</strong> Lessons
are framed by real-world questions, encouraging exploration of voice, identity,
and values.</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hands-On Projects:</strong> Tasks
like ad creation, podcasting, and visual storytelling let students apply
language learning in creative formats.</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Writing
and speaking tasks mirror real-life communication, from advocating for
causes to promoting responsible tourism.</p>
<p><strong>Future Readiness</strong>
</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Learners for Life:</strong> Reflection
routines and feedback help students develop self-awareness and ownership
of learning.</p>
<p>‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Adaptable Communicators:</strong> Students
learn to tailor their language to audience and purpose, across formal and
informal contexts.</p>
