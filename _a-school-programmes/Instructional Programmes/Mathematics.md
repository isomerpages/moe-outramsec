<h4><strong>ðŸ’¡ Skills Development</strong></h4>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Mathematics department aims to nurture students to become confident problem-solvers and self-directed learners, through innovative teaching approaches and carefully curated learning experiences.</a>
</p>
<p>Our classrooms are learning spaces where students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop <strong>Critical and Inventive Thinking</strong> through collaborative
problem-solving using authentic tasks. Students learn to approach complex
mathematical challenges with creativity and analytical rigour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen <strong>Communication and Collaboration Skills</strong> via student-led
discussions and peer instruction sessions. Students articulate their mathematical
reasoning, engage in mathematical discourse, and learn to work effectively
in teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance their <strong>Digital Literacy</strong> through integration of technology,
including GeoGebra and spreadsheets for mathematical exploration and data
visualisation, and collaborative tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our students will be able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios, developing their
ability to connect classroom learning with practical applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in reflection activities to deepen their mathematical thinking
and metacognitive skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will develop into lifelong learners who approach problems with
curiosity and perseverance, upholding honesty in their reasoning and solutions,
and contribute to real-world issues that impact their communities.</p>
<h4><strong>ðŸš€ Signature Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>Mathematics Trail â€“ Students extend their learning of Mathematics through
activities, with the aim of appreciating Mathematics in the real-world
context. They will learn and apply mathematical concepts, and develop metacognitive
skills as they solve the hand on tasks in a team.</p>
<p>Mathematical Olympiad Programme â€“ Developing the studentâ€™s logical reasoning
and communication skills through higher order mathematics, Outramians participate
in Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) and Singapore and Asian Schools
Math Olympiad (SASMO).</p>
<p>Enrichment Programme â€“ Students take part in external programmes (e.g.
TP X VJC Data Science Hackathon) to appreciate the connections between
Mathematics and the real world and discover their interests in different
branches of Mathematics.</p>
