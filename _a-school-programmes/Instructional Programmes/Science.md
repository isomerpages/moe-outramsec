<h4><strong>ðŸ’¡ Skills Development</strong></h4>
<p>In the Science Department, our students engage deeply with the world around
them through a rich and forward-looking curriculum that nurtures both scientific
knowledge and skills as well as essential 21st Century Competencies (e21CC).
As students explore key scientific concepts, they also build a strong foundation
in critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and digital
literacyâ€”skills that are crucial for navigating and thriving in a rapidly
changing world.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our lessons are designed to encourage students to ask questions, challenge
assumptions, and think independently. Whether they are constructing explanations
based on data, discussing solutions with peers, or presenting findings
from experiments, students are constantly sharpening their ability to reason,
express ideas clearly, work in teams, and think innovatively.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Approaches</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We adopt inquiry-based learning, hands-on investigations, and inter-disciplinary
tasks that connect science to real-world contexts. Students learn to ask
meaningful questions, design experiments, and make sense of data through
practical experiences. In line with the growing use of technology in education
and work, students are also introduced to the use of AI tools to support
their learningâ€”for example, generating explanations, exploring simulations,
or analysing scientific ideas. Through these activities, they also learn
to critically evaluate sources of information, develop digital discernment,
and use technology responsibly as part of their scientific inquiry.</p>

<p><strong>Future Readiness</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By developing these competencies, students grow not only in scientific
knowledge but also in resilience, adaptability, and a lifelong learning
mindset. Our aim is to nurture scientifically literate individuals who
are curious, resourceful, and prepared to contribute meaningfully to society,
both locally and globally.</p>
<h4><strong>ðŸš€ Signature Programmes [Max 3 programmes]</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Innovators in Action</strong> â€“ Students take part in enrichment
workshops (e.g., SIT-VJC Project Inspire) that focus on science, engineering,
and innovation. These hands-on sessions expose them to emerging technologies
and develop their creative and problem-solving abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scientistsâ€™ Arena</strong> â€“ Through national and school-based
competitions such as the Singapore Junior Chemistry, Biology, and Physics
Olympiads, as well as the Physics League, students stretch their thinking
and apply their knowledge in rigorous, real-world contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Voices from the Frontier</strong> â€“ Talks by scientists, astronauts,
and industry professionals designed to inspire, inform, and ignite studentsâ€™
passion for science by connecting them with role models at the forefront
of scientific discovery.</p>
