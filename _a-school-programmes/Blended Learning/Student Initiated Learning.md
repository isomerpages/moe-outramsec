<p><strong>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) Pilot for Secondary Three Normal Academic/ Express Students</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) programme is part of the Ministry
of Educationâ€™s blueprint for students to grow to be independent learners
who learn for life. At Outram Secondary School, we have designed a unique
experience for Outramians that seeks to develop their intrinsic motivation
and nurture self-directed learning, where they can explore their interests
and passions, and learn within and beyond the curriculum.</p>
