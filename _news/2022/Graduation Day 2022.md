Graduation Day 2022 was a poignant but memorable occasion for staff and graduating students. After the three school leaders had given their speeches, there was a montage video. Class representatives gave a short speech to recount their good times and thank their teachers. Afterwhich students  were treated to a sumptuous spread of buffet food, table games and fancy photo booth taking. All in all, it was a good round up to the Class of 2022!  
  
We would also wish all graduating students the best of effort for their National Exams!
