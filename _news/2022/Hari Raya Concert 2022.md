18 May 2022 (Wed) marked Outram Secondary School’s Hari Raya Puasa celebration. With the relaxation of safety distancing measures, the school could hardly contain their excitement when it was announced that a school concert would be held.  

Many Muslim and non-Muslim students and staff alike, chose to be attired in traditional costumes of their respective ethnicities and cultures. As the school readied to assemble as one, there was spontaneous applause as Mr Boo and Mr Hazlan led a retinue of students from the back to the front of the hall. The concert, despite having very little preparation time, was prepared both efficiently and innovatively.

Apart from well-choreographed student dancers and silat performances, there was a well-structured drama segment. This segment featured both live role play performances and pre-recorded segments of teachers and students. It featured the expected norms and customs of how Muslims conduct visits to family and friends.

Overall, it was a lively, animated and entertaining session which also informed the rest of students about the significance of the fasting month that had passed by.
