Dear parents,

Your child would be moving on to his/her post-secondary education soon. Do you have questions about the new pathways that have been opened up? Or are you wondering how you can better support your child in choosing a post-secondary pathway?

Join MOE’s seminar on 1 June – “Preparing for Your Child’s Transition to Post-Secondary Education”, to hear from a panel comprising of an Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counsellor, a parent, and representatives from ITE, JC and Poly.



Thank you!
