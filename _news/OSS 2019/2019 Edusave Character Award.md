MOE has introduced a new Edusave Character Award (ECHA) to **enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions**.  This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

  

The ECHA is meant to recognise and affirm students who demonstrated exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.  Students must satisfy the following eligibility criteria before they can be given the ECHA:

The Edusave Character Award is open to pupils from all levels.

  

ECHA Awardees will receive a certificate and a monetary voucher of $500.  This award will be presented at a platform determined by MOE.

  

**Eligibility Criteria**

(a)  Students must be Singaporeans studying in government/ government-aided primary or secondary schools, independent schools, specialised independent schools, specialised schools or junior colleges/ centralised institute (JC/CI); and

  

(b)  Students must, on a consistent basis, **demonstrate good character and values.**  In particular, students may be identified for demonstrating the following types of qualities:

  

(i)            **School values and/or character traits** that the school wishes to recognise or encourage, e.g. respect, integrity, care, harmony; and/or

(ii)          **A high level of civic responsibility**.  These would be students who are concerned about issues in the community or issues faced by others, initiating action to address these issues to improve the lives of others, and being committed to make a positive difference; and/or overcome the odds and still do commendably well in academic and non-academic domains.

(iii)         **Qualities associated with resilience**.  These would be students who have persevered despite facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, family issues, health issues etc.), and have managed to overcome the odds.
