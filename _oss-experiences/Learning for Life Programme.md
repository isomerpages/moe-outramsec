#### **'Sports For Life' @ Outram Sec School**

  

  

**Vision**  





We Nurture Champions for Sports and Life.

  

**3Is Sports Mission**

**Instil** Life skills

**Inculcate** Life Values

**Inspire** Life-long Learning

Through sports, we aim to instil 21st Century Competencies in each student to better prepare them to thrive in a fast-changing and highly connected world.

  

**Character Development Approach: Head, Heart & Hand**

**_Head: To Know_**

**_Heart: To Feel_**

**_Hand: To Do_**

The PE department approach towards character development through the Sports For Life @ Outram involves teaching the students the school values and equipping them with SEL competencies (To Know) through CCE and providing platforms for students to practice and demonstrate the values (To Feel) through play and competition and encouraging students to adopt the values in their own lives (To Do) in classroom, school and community.

All students will be **exposed** in at least 6 sports throughout their 4/5 years PE lessons in Outram to build a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation. 

Through sport, we want to **enrich** students’ school experiences to build self-esteem, renew interest in learning and develop critical life skills. Students leaders will be **empowered** to lead, plan and organise sport events and run CCA sports camp. Individuals with good performance and demonstrated talent can invest their time and effort in highly specialised and intensive training with national sports organisations to **excel**.
