**Thank You Teachers!**

Outramians showed their appreciation to their beloved teachers this Teachers' Day! On this special day, teachers were showered with thoughtful gifts, heartfelt hand-written messages and a delightful line-up of performances painstakingly put together by the student council and many talented student performers. The Caring Teacher Awards 2018 were also presented to deserving teachers who are exemplary in their roles as they demonstrate qualities of a caring teacher. Our heartiest congratulations to award recipients, Ms Tan Boon Hwee, Mrs Cheryl Fan, Mrs Wong Ann Ann, Ms Tan Xiling and Mdm Haslinda!
