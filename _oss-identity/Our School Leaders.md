<p><strong>Our journey as Outram Secondary School is akin to the growth of a giant tree – one that has grown with deep roots and wide-reaching branches. The roots represent our heritage, the values and traditions that ground us, and our reverence to the school motto: <em>Labor Omnia Vincit</em> (<em>Labour Conquers All</em>). The trunk stands as a testament to the unwavering commitment of our Outramians, educators and community to lifelong learning and character development. The branches stretch skyward, reaching for new possibilities and embodying our vision: <em>Learners for Life, Leaders of Integrity, Contributors with Compassion</em>.</strong>

<p><strong>In 2026, we will take a bold step forward as we relocate to our new Anchorvale Campus, while continuing to nurture our students at the York Hill Campus. For two years, we will flourish across both campuses, expanding our reach and deepening our impact. Like a tree thriving in new soil while remaining anchored in its roots, we will embrace this transition with resilience, unity, and purpose.</strong>

<p><strong>As we stand on the threshold of an exciting new chapter in our school’s journey, we celebrate a remarkable milestone – our 120th anniversary in 2026. For over a century, Outram Secondary School has been a beacon of learning, integrity, and compassion, shaping generations of Outramians who continue to make a meaningful difference in the world. The Anchor campus as a School of the Future is perhaps the best gift Outram Secondary School receives as her birthday present!</strong>

<p><strong>To our current Outramians (and their parents) at our historic York Hill Campus: as the final batches to walk through the gates of our beloved York Hill Campus, your impact will be felt in the intangible culture and values you have co-created for all Outramians. Your legacy will live on in the contributions you make to society in the years ahead. We are honoured to have been part of your childhood memories and growth, and those of many generations that have come before you.</strong>

<p><strong>To our prospective and future students (and their parents) at the new Anchorvale Campus: as the first batches to walk through the gates of our School of the Future, your impact will be felt in exemplifying our school values for future generations of Outramians. Your legacy will be shaped by the pioneering work you will contribute to, long after you have graduated. We are privileged and excited to be a part of your formative years and those of many generations that will come after you.</strong>

<p><strong>As we prepare for this new chapter, we invite every member of our school community – Outramians, parents, alumni, and staff – to journey with us. Together, we honour our past, strengthen our present, and step boldly into the future, ensuring that the voices of all our Outramians and staff are heard. We empower them to co-create rich educational experiences within an inclusive community of future-ready learners. We are One Outram, One Community!</strong>
