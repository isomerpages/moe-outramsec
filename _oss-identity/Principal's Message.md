#### **DEAR OUTRAMIANS,**&nbsp;



As a **_School of the Future_**, we envision the Future of Learning to be anchored on the Future of Teaching. Learners and educators will come together as a community to leverage on the affordances of technology and intentionally shape the learning environment to spark joy and co-create rich learning experiences. Not only will this community take ownership of teaching and learning, they will also embody the science of it in a virtuous cycle to ignite curiosity and purposeful engagement with technological tools to enhance understanding and application in the real-world context. Our strategic student and staff outcomes will guide us in providing a student-centred, values-driven education for all Outramians, in alignment with MOE’s directions for 21st Century Competencies and Educational Technology Master Plan 2030.

As we approach the school’s 120th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of phenomenal organisational transformation while getting the best birthday gift of a brand new campus. As the Principal, I am intensely grateful and very privileged to have the opportunity to create the next lap for Outram Secondary – for, in an alternate reality, it could have been another school taking over the Anchorvale campus, or we could have faced a school closure or merger. We should not take for granted what pioneering entails. I am humbled by the teamwork and tenacity of many dedicated personnel – from receiving well-wishes from hopeful stakeholders to partnering various agencies to overcome challenges and see the fruition of a new educational building.

Understanding that a campus does not make an educational institution, just as a house does not make a home, I am ever more mindful of the critical challenge of the operational realities of a dual campus and steering an evolving culture as student enrolment and staff strength expands. Hence, I am reminded that the heart of education lies in the fostering and celebration of human values, character, and holistic well-being in our Outramian staff, students and immediate stakeholders. It is thus my fervent wish that each of us nurtures a Sense of Hope, a Sense of Belonging, a Sense of Reality, culminating in the Will to Act. And in developing these dispositions, I invite all of us to reflect how we can help each other

*   &nbsp;feel heard and belong in the school environment;
*   &nbsp;appreciate diversity;
*   &nbsp;empower ourselves to contribute to the school and community;
*   &nbsp;support our well-being; and
*   &nbsp;work together.

The closure of the York Hill campus at the end of 2027 may be imminent, but I have faith that the Outramian SPIRIT will live on. It will continue to empower us as we embark on a new era&nbsp; together to co-create new learning and development programmes which are enriched by technology, and supported by the thoughtfully designed learning spaces at the Anchorvale campus.

_Labor Omnia Vincit_ – let us embrace the work before us to build an even more vibrant future for our school.
