At Outram Secondary School, we encourage parents to keep in touch with their children’s teachers because we recognise the value of such partnerships. We welcome parents to e-mail or make telephone calls to the teachers concerned. If there is a need to see the Principal, Vice-Principal or any other teachers, please feel free to make an appointment in advance.

From Year 2026 onwards, as the school transitions to operating on **dual campuses (York Hill Campus and Anchorvale Campus)**, we kindly remind all stakeholders to check the location of the relevant staff or appointment before coming to the school. This will help us ensure a smooth and coordinated experience for everyone.
