At Outram Secondary School, we encourage parents to keep in touch with their children’s teachers because we recognise the value of such partnerships.
We welcome parents to e-mail or make telephone calls to the teachers concerned. If there is a need to see the Principal, Vice-Principal or any other teachers, please feel free to make an appointment in advance.

From Year 2026 onwards, as the school transitions to operating on dual campuses (York Hill Campus and Anchorvale Campus), we kindly remind all stakeholders to check the location of the relevant staff or appointment before coming to the school. This will help us ensure a smooth and coordinated experience for everyone.
