**Prior to 1874**  
Prior to 1874, in response to a need to provide the opportunity of learning English through the medium of the mother tongue of the various races, two schools were built in Singapore, one at Cross Street and other at Kampong Glam.

**Establishment of School**  
As the numbers in the school at Cross Street grew, there was a plan to establish a training school to meet demands. But for some unknown reasons, this plan did not materialise. A new school, Outram Road School, built at Outram Road, was formally opened by the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Anderson on 26th February 1906. By Gazette notification in 1939 the word "Road" was deleted and the school was known as Outram School.

**Early History From 1906**  
Outram School functioned as a Primary School. Acting as feeder school, Pearl's Hill Standard One proceeded to Standard Two at Outram. Likewise, Outram was the feeder school to Raffles Institution. The working arrangement between Pearl's Hill School and Outram School continued up to January 1953 whereas the working agreement between Outram and Raffles Institution ceased with the fall of Singapore in February 1942. After the war, Outram boys competed with other Government Primary School pupils in securing places in Government Secondary Schools.

**Lost Records (1906 to 1942)**  
Under the orders of the Education Department, Mr SG Mohamed Ghows, who was Outram's Principal in 1941, sent all Outram School's records to the Pasir Panjang English School for safe keeping. Subsequently, this school suffered a direct hit during the Japanese War and with it went all Outram's past records, from 1906 to 1942.

**Conversion into a Secondary School in 1954**  
On 1st January 1954, Outram ceased to be a purely Primary School and was converted to a four year Secondary Commercial School with a four year secondary school course leading to the School Certificate of Commercial Education of the London Chamber of Commerce. With the conversion, the school motto was changed from "ON TO SUCCESS" to "LABOR OMNIA VINCIT" – Labour Conquers All. The School's crest was also changed.
