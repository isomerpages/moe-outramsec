<p>At Outram Secondary School, our Sport Climbing CCA offers students a dynamic
environment to build both physical and mental strength. Through top rope
climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing, students not only develop essential
climbing skills, but also cultivate leadership qualities by guiding and
developing their juniors and team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our CCA is a cluster CCA, bringing together students from Gan Eng
Seng Secondary and St Theresa's Convent. This unique arrangement provides
students from schools without this CCA the opportunity to experience sport
climbing. It also fosters greater collaboration, as students from different
schools and backgrounds work together, forming friendships to achieve a
common goal as one climbing family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our programme emphasises resilience, problem-solving, and teamwork.
Whether students are navigating routes on our training walls or participating
in external competitions, they collaborate to strategise and solve problems
as a team, figuring out how to conquer each wall. This teamwork strengthens
both their problem-solving skills and their trust in one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to climbing, we organise team bonding activities designed
to build camaraderie and strengthen friendships within the CCA. These enjoyable,
engaging events create a cohesive, united team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Aligned with the schoolâ€™s focus on nurturing Learners for Life and
Leaders of Integrity, our CCA instils confidence, builds character, and
empowers students to take on leadership roles. Sport climbing at Outram
is a holistic journey that shapes students for life beyond the walls.</p>
