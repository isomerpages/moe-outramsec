<p>At our basketball CCA, we focus on developing both physical fitness and
basketball skills, while nurturing discipline and leadership in our students.
We believe in creating learners for life and leaders of integrity.</p>
<p>We participate in various competitions, including the National School
Games B and C divisions, which provide excellent opportunities for our
players to test their skills and showcase their talents.</p>
<p>We also organise friendly matches and mini-tournaments with our partnering
schools. These events not only hone our players' abilities but also foster
valuable connections with peers from different schools.</p>
<p>Our CCA emphasises the values of responsibility, resilience, teamwork,
and sportsmanship. Through rigorous training and competitive play, we cultivate
these qualities in our students, preparing them for challenges both on
and off the court.</p>
