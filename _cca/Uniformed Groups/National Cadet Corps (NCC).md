<br>At Outram Secondary School, our National Cadet Corps (NCC) unit is dedicated
to shaping students into resilient leaders and lifelong learners. We focus
on developing physical fitness and imparting military-related knowledge
and skills, while nurturing essential qualities such as confidence, communication,
resilience, and leadership.</p>
<p>Our cadets engage in a diverse range of activities designed to challenge
and inspire. We participate in exciting laser tag sessions, master foot
drills, and undergo rigorous physical fitness training. Our Situational
Awareness Challenges and confidence courses push cadets to their limits,
fostering mental toughness and problem-solving skills. We also take part
in HQ-organised activities, including immersive day camps that provide
hands-on learning experiences.</p>
<p>Through these activities, we aim to cultivate 'Learners for Life' and
'Leaders of Integrity' â€“ key student outcomes that align with our school's
vision. Our NCC unit instils a passion for continuous learning and personal
growth, while emphasising the importance of ethical leadership and strong
moral character.</p>
