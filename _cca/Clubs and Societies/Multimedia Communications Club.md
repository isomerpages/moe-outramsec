<p>The Multimedia Communications Club (MCC) is an info-comm club for language
and</p>
<p>media lovers. We gather and develop talents in creative writing, and multimedia</p>
<p>projects. In particular we create videos showcasing life in OSS for various
school</p>
<p>celebrations and initiatives. MCC’s goal is to empower members to be confident</p>
<p>communicators, we hone our members’ writing and video production skills
by</p>
<p>conducting training in media technology, public speaking and videography.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MCC members participate in media-related competitions each year. In recent
years, members</p>
<p>have participated in numerous competitions including, the National Digital
Storytelling</p>
