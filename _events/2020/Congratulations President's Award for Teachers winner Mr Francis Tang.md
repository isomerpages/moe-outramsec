Outram Secondary is proud of our teachers who were nominated for The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) 2020 for being caring, inspiring and excellent educators in their own ways.

Amongst the deserving teacher nominees, Mr Francis Tang received the highest accolade any teacher can have. In recognition of his contributions to the school and students under his charge, Mr Tang received the PAT 2020 from President Halimah Yacob during the Teachers’ Day Celebration and Award Ceremony held virtually on Thursday, 3 September 2020. 

A Senior Teacher, and also the Water Polo Teacher-in-charge, Mr Francis Tang constantly adopts innovative approaches in engaging his students during his lessons and in shaping the character of the Water Polo boys. Beyond fulfilling his duties as a teacher, Mr Tang is also a mentor to his peers as he often willingly and readily shares his experiences and teaching strategies with other fellow teachers. Through his words and actions, Mr Tang is truly an inspiration to those around him.

When invited to provide words of motivation to future generations of Outramians, Mr Tang passionately sounded out the following, _**“Every student can and wants to learn, and every teacher wants to and can teach well.”**_
